# ExcelToolkit
This is a simple tool to rename excel workbooks and worksheets in a folder without opening them one by one or writing any vba code. It currently only works with .xlsx files.

# Application Usage
- Select the folder with the excel files
- The files with the sheets will appear in a tree strcture
- Click any name in the tree to rename it

# Notes
Renaming files are much faster than renaming sheets. Renaming sheets of huge excel files may take a few seconds
